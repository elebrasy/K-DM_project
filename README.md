# Problem Description

Schedule Parent-Teacher meetings. Each meeting between parent(s) and a teacher lasts for the same fixed amount of time for convenience, we want to find a schedule so that every person’s conferences occur in consecutive time slots.

Input: $n$ teachers, $m$ parents, and a $m × n$ matrix $S_{ij}$ and
$S_{ij} = 1$ if teacher $j$ has a student whose parent is $i$ otherwise is equal to $0$
